# Background

Canada needs an energy agenda for 2026–2030 that supports four goals at the same time: (1) affordable energy for households and firms, (2) reliable energy supply, (3) lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and (4) strong investment and job creation. Energy policy choices made during this period will shape Canada’s emissions trajectory, energy costs, and competitiveness for many years. Two policy directions aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are especially relevant: expanding the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption (SDG 7.2.1) and reducing energy intensity (SDG 7.3.1).

SDG 7.2.1 measures the proportion of total final energy consumption that comes from renewable sources such as hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. A higher renewable share generally indicates a cleaner energy supply mix and lower emissions from energy production. SDG 7.3.1 measures energy intensity, defined as the amount of energy supplied to the economy per unit of economic output (GDP). Lower energy intensity values indicate that the economy uses less energy to produce one unit of value. While energy intensity is not a perfect measure of technical efficiency—because it is also influenced by economic structure, climate, and activity mix—it is widely used to track progress in reducing energy demand relative to growth.

Recent Canadian data illustrates why both levers matter. Statistics Canada reported that in 2023 overall energy use decreased by 0.5% while real GDP increased by 2.0%, and GHG emissions declined by 0.9%. This pattern suggests progress through a combination of cleaner energy supply and reduced energy intensity. On the supply side, Canada already has a strong renewable electricity base. According to the Canada Energy Regulator, renewable generation capacity increased from about 63% of total electricity capacity in 2010 to roughly 69% in 2023, with projections suggesting it could reach around 73% by 2030. These trends show that renewable expansion is feasible, but further growth may become more challenging as system constraints tighten.

The decision between prioritizing renewable expansion and reducing energy intensity is difficult because both options require resources and face tradeoffs. Expanding renewable energy can significantly reduce emissions, but it depends on grid modernization, new transmission lines, energy storage, and faster project permitting. These investments can take many years, face local opposition, and increase near-term system costs if infrastructure does not keep pace with generation. If grid capacity lags behind renewable deployment, projects may be delayed or curtailed, reducing their short-term impact.

Reducing energy intensity can slow growth in energy demand and help control costs, but it relies on many small, decentralized actions. These include building retrofits, equipment upgrades, industrial process improvements, and behavioral changes. Program effectiveness depends on design, funding stability, and adoption rates. Results may vary across regions and income groups, and benefits can take time to materialize. In addition, rebound effects can occur: when energy services become cheaper due to efficiency gains, households and firms may increase usage, reducing net energy savings.

A further challenge is governance and sequencing. Provinces and territories control many aspects of electricity planning and energy regulation, while the federal government influences outcomes through funding, tax credits, standards, and coordination. Although a balanced approach may be ideal in theory, federal budgets and administrative capacity are limited. For the 2026–2030 period, policymakers must decide which lever should lead, how the two approaches should be sequenced, and how success should be measured using SDG indicators and Canada-specific data.

Key stakeholders in this decision include federal departments such as Natural Resources Canada, provincial and territorial governments, electric utilities and grid operators, renewable energy developers, energy-intensive industries, households and small businesses, Indigenous governments and communities, and municipalities responsible for local permitting and land-use decisions. Each group experiences different costs, benefits, and risks depending on the chosen policy emphasis.

Canada already pursues both renewable deployment and energy intensity reduction through existing programs and standards. The central policy question for 2026–2030 is not whether to support clean energy, but where to place the strongest federal priority and how to allocate limited resources to achieve the greatest impact on affordability, reliability, and emissions.


## Key stakeholders

- Federal government (Natural Resources Canada and related departments): sets national priorities, funding, and standards.
- Provincial and territorial governments: plan power systems and run many efficiency programs.
- Electric utilities and grid operators: build and operate generation, transmission, and distribution.
- Oil and gas producers and energy-intensive industry: affected by policy direction, costs, and demand changes.
- Renewable energy developers and equipment suppliers: depend on project pipelines, permits, and grid access.
- Households and small businesses: experience energy bills, retrofit costs, and service reliability.
- Indigenous governments and communities: rights, benefits, and impacts tied to project siting and land use.
- Municipalities and regulators: local permitting, zoning, and community acceptance.
